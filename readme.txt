Some image compression tools destroy images with as much as a 30% loss in quality. Our servers strip hidden bulky information from your images and reduce file size without affecting the appearance.

Smush meticulously scans every image you upload – or have already added to your site – cuts all the unnecessary data and scales it for you before adding it to your media library.

### Compress any Image in any Directory

In addition to smushing your media uploads, you may want to compress the images stored in other folders. Smush now lets you compress any image in any directory so that you can optimize all the images on your site – including [NextGEN](https://wordpress.org/plugins/nextgen-gallery/) images, images stored on Amazon S3 using [WP Offload Media](https://wordpress.org/plugins/amazon-s3-and-cloudfront/) and images in EVERY WordPress plugin and theme package!

### Compatible with Your Favorite Themes, Builders and Media Library Plugins

No matter what theme or plugins you use to better manage your WordPress media library, Smush has you covered. Check out just a few of the popular products Smush is working with to help make your site faster and more efficient:

### Incorrect Size Image Detection
Smush now includes a wrong size image finder. Activate and your images will be highlighted with smart tips for scaling your images. Quickly locate the images that are keeping you from getting that perfect 100 on your Google PageSpeed test.

### Defer Offscreen Images
Smush has lazy load built-in. If your page has a bunch of images below the fold, lazy loading will drastically speed up your page by serving only the images being viewed and delaying others further down the page.

★★★★★

Overall it really fits my needs and I’ll be willing to upgrade to pro if my needs change. I’d recommend it to clients/friends without hesitation. Keep it up!” - [tarkan_](https://wordpress.org/support/users/tarkan_/)

### What about Multisite?

Smush can be used to optimize all the images across your entire network! Use global settings or configure each site individually.

Smush is super easy to use – no confusing compression software settings. Smush images in your library one at a time or bulk smush up to 50 images at a time.  Plus, configure auto-smush to asynchronously scale and compress some or all of your images as they are being uploaded – it's incredibly fast.

The faster your site loads, the more Google, Bing, Yahoo and other search engines will like it. Your site will load faster and rank higher.

### Privacy

Smush does not interact with end users on your website. The only input option Smush has is to a newsletter subscription for site admins only.

Smush uses a third-party email service (Drip) to send informational emails ( Opt-in) to the site administrator. The administrator's email address is sent to Drip and a cookie is set by the service. Only administrator information is collected by Drip.

Smush sends images to the WPMU DEV servers to optimize them for web use. This includes the transfer of EXIF data. The EXIF data will either be stripped or returned as it is. It is not stored on the WPMU DEV servers.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= I just finished running Smush and Google PageSpeed still says my images need compressing and resizing. How do I fix it? =

This means your images were not properly scaled for where they are being displayed. Scaling images before uploading them can be time-consuming but can save space and speedup load time. First, determine what size your image needs to be. You can use the built-in images size detector included in the free version of Smush to find what height and width your image should be. Once you know how large the image should be, scale your images to the right size.

= PageSpeed Insights is telling me to defer offscreen images. Can Smush fix that?

Lazy Load will defer your offscreen images from loading until they are needed. From the Smush Dashboard select Lazy Load and click Activate. Smush Lazy Load works out of the box or can be customized based on your needs.

*Tip:* If you're having any issues or want to save a tone of time, The Smush Pro CDN includes auto resizing.

= Does Smush delete or replace my original full-size images? =

Nope. WordPress crops and resizes every image you upload for embedding on your site. By default, Smush only compresses these cropped and resized images, not your original full-size images. To compress your original full-sized images use [Smush Pro](https://premium.wpmudev.org/project/wp-smush-pro/?utm_source=wordpress.org&utm_medium=readme&utm_campaign=smush-readme&utm_content=smush_pro#trial).

= What type of file should I use for my images (GIF, PNG, JPG)? =

GIF files are large and can’t be optimized much. They should only be used if the image is animated.


PNG is best for computer generated graphics (vectors, logos, fonts, etc.), images with few colors or images with transparency.


JPG should be used for photography or images with a lot of color variation.

*Tip:* The Smush Pro CDN includes WebP compression - sharper images that are 25 to 30 percent smaller than JPEG and PNG files.

= I’m a photographer can I keep all my EXIF data? =

Yes! EXIF data stores camera settings, focal length, date, time and location information in image files. EXIF data makes image files larger but if you are a photographer you may want to preserve this information. We have included the option to preserve EXIF image data in Smush.

= I just ran Bulk Smush and some of my images didn't get compressed? =

First, check to see if you're receiving any server errors. If your images seem to be processing correctly check the file size of the images being skipped. Images over 5mb will be skipped. To compress images up to 32mb get [Smush Pro](https://premium.wpmudev.org/project/wp-smush-pro/?utm_source=wordpress.org&utm_medium=readme&utm_campaign=smush-readme&utm_content=wp_smush_pro#trial).

= I activated Smush and I don’t see any difference in image quality. How am I supposed to know if Smush is working? =

Great question! It is important to understand Smush is an optimization tool that uses lossless image compression to save disk storage space and speed up your site. Smush squeezes data from your image files that will save space, resize huge images, and improve speed without changing quality.

You can track file size changes in your media library, individual image savings, directory savings, and Smush total savings with Smush stats. If you want to see some additional magic, run before-and-after page-speed tests with WP Checkup or Google PageSpeed Insights. Every little bit of resource savings is important when it comes to page-speed!

= Can't I just use Photoshop or another image editing application to optimize my images? =

Optimizing all the image sizes generated by WordPress, images being imported from plugins and themes, and images from other web sites is a painful and time-consuming process.

Smush automatically handles optimizing all your images no matter where they come from and  can be used as a standalone tool or alongside Photoshop.

= My Google PageSpeed test is telling me to serve images in Next-Gen formats. Can Smush do that? =

WebP and other Next-Gen formats are not supported on all browsers and require fallback images. For that reason, WebP conversion is only available in Smush Pro. Smush Pro converts images to WebP for a 25-30% savings over JPEG and PNG and serves fallback images on unsupported browsers.

= Is it optimize or optimise? =
It depends what side of the pond you live on...but whether you say optimize, optimise, optimizer or Smush goddess of speed, this plugin will make sure your images are loading lighting fast.
